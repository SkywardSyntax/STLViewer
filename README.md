# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Next.js

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running Next.js! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Next.js.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with the what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

To run this application:

```
npm run dev
```

## STL File Viewer

This project allows you to upload an STL file and render it using the GPU with WebGL.

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Upload an STL file using the file input.

6. The STL file will be rendered using WebGL.

### Error Handling

#### RangeError Exceptions

If a RangeError occurs, it indicates an out-of-bounds access. This can happen if the STL file is malformed or if there is an issue with the file reading process. The application will display an error message indicating the RangeError.

#### Out-of-Bounds Access Errors

Out-of-bounds access errors can occur if the application tries to read data outside the bounds of the STL file. This can happen if the file is corrupted or if there is an issue with the file reading process. The application will display an error message indicating the out-of-bounds access error.
